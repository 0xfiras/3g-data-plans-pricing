# 3G Data plans in Lebanon

This is a toy project I did while self-isolating, as a personal curiosity.

Check the [python notebook](./plot.ipynb) for more details on the history of 3G data plans in
Lebanon.

I don't have the timestamps for the change in pricings. The articles on
`touch`'s website are not timestamped, and didn't feel like looking them up
in newspapers. It doesn't really matter.
